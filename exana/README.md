Numerical analysis of neuroscience data

This is a common repository for analysis scripts that are as general as possible

Analysis scripts added should fulfill the following requirements:
 - Unit testing
 - Tested properly
 - Testing testing testing
 - Generalized
 - Well documented
 - Doc string
 - Examples
 
By generalized we mean that the added scripts should be usefull to more than one particular persion/use case - if you are the only one understanding this function, it does not belong in this repo.
